# How-to PhD
This site serves as a collection of resources and information for concrete skills that are helpful when
pursuing a PhD in computer science (specifically in ML/AI or related disciplines). The goal is to cover a
variety of aspects of the PhD experience, including concrete research skills, communication skills,
intrapersonal skills, among others. This site is **still under construction**, so while feedback is certainly welcome, and the preliminary content may already be useful, be warned that it is not finalized by any stretch.

If you have comments on the information presented here, want to offer alternative resources, differing
perspectives, suggest other topics/questions, or offer any other feedback, _let me know_! You can leave an
issue on the github, at [https://github.com/mmcdermott/How-to-PhD](https://github.com/mmcdermott/How-to-PhD)
or connect with me via email at [mmd@mit.edu](mailto:mmd@mit.edu) or
