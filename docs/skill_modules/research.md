## Starting Projects
### Guiding Questions
  1. How do you scope a new project?
  2. How do you determine the preliminary milestones and timeline of a new project?
  3. How do you do a literature review for a new project?
       1. How do you find relevant papers?
       2. How do you read papers you do find? _Also see general paper reading question._

### Specific Resources
#### [How to do good research, get in published in SIGKDD, and get it cited!](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/Keogh_SIGKDD09_tutorial.pdf)
This guide is largely focused on hos to structure projects for publication and impact, and is very related to
communication questions as well. It is thus also featured in the [communication](skill_modules/communication)
section of this guide, but it is very relevant here too!

#### [Stanford InfoLab Tips for Writing Technical Papers](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/widom/paper-writing.html)
This guide is a great starting point for writing technical papers. I particularly value their discussion on
the introduction, which states that an effective introduction must focus on answering five key questions:
  1. What is the problem?
  2. Why is it interesting and important?
  3. Why is it hard? (E.g., why do naive approaches fail?)
  4. Why hasn't it been solved before? (Or, what's wrong with previous proposed solutions? How does mine differ?)
  5. What are the key components of my approach and results? Also include any specific limitations.

I highlight this resource here (as well as in the [communications](communication) section) because you need to
do research such that you can eventual frame it into a compelling paper/project. Therefore, thinking about how
you would frame your project, even as you're just beginning the work, can help you structure the project
overall.

## Finishing Projects
### Guiding Questions
  1. How much of time is spent at various stages and in various tasks of a project? E.g., how much time is
     spent doing ideation vs. literature review, experiment design, coding, writing, etc.?
  2. What is your general philosophy for working on an established project? E.g.,...
       1. To what extent do you have a running draft that is a "living" reflection of your project?
       2. Are you laser focused on the next minimum viable experiment, or are you more responsive to
          observations you make along the way?
       3. How do you trade-off time locally between experimentation, writing, figure design, etc.?
  3. When do you (drastically) pivot a project to something new?
  3. When do you give up on a project? When do you keep pushing?
