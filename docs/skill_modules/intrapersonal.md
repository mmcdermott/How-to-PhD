#### Key Concepts
##### The Grad Student Fallacy
**The Grad Student Fallacy** is the fallacy of believing *"I just need to wait until this next round of
deadlines passes, and then things will finally calm down and I'll be able to take a breather."* 
This is a fallacy because, of course, things will not calm down after the next deadline, and you'll soon find
yourself feeling just as stressed and just as "down to the wire" focused on the next, next deadline, at which
point you'll repeat the same thinking trap. This fallacy is called the "grad student" fallacy, because it
obviously does not end when you graduate, but instead follows you into your career indefinitely.

I highlight this thinking trap *not* because in fact you can never take a breather or because things will
never calm down, but rather because to surmount this fallacy you need to realize that you will *always* feel
deadline stress during a PhD, and find your own personal strategies to make peace with that, to allow yourself
time off and space away, and to manage your stress despite the never-ending stream of deadlines.
