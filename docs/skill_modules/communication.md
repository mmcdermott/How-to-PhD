#### [Stanford InfoLab Tips for Writing Technical Papers](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/widom/paper-writing.html)
This guide is a great starting point for writing technical papers. I particularly value their discussion on
the introduction, which states that an effective introduction must focus on answering five key questions:
  1. What is the problem?
  2. Why is it interesting and important?
  3. Why is it hard? (E.g., why do naive approaches fail?)
  4. Why hasn't it been solved before? (Or, what's wrong with previous proposed solutions? How does mine differ?)
  5. What are the key components of my approach and results? Also include any specific limitations.

#### [How to do good research, get in published in SIGKDD, and get it cited!](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/Keogh_SIGKDD09_tutorial.pdf)
This guide is more comprehensive than just focusing on the writing part, and is featured also in the
[research](skill_modules/research) section of this guide, but it is very relevant here too! Note the synergy
between this and the Stanford InfoLab tips above.

The first place to start when thinking about how to be a better reviewer is by looking at the guidelines
posted by the venues asking for reviews! Here are a few:
