  1. [Stanford InfoLab Tips for Writing Technical Papers](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/widom/paper-writing.html)
     This guide is a great starting point for writing technical papers. I particularly value their discussion on
     the introduction, which states that an effective introduction must focus on answering five key questions:
    1. What is the problem?
    2. Why is it interesting and important?
    3. Why is it hard? (E.g., why do naive approaches fail?)
    4. Why hasn't it been solved before? (Or, what's wrong with previous proposed solutions? How does mine differ?)
    5. What are the key components of my approach and results? Also include any specific limitations.
