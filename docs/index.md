# How-to PhD
**Under Construction** Please check back later! This is still mostly under construction.

This website is intended to serve as a collection of pointers to helpful resources, interviews, presentations,
etc. which help teach a set of concrete skills that are integral to effectively pursuing a PhD (particularly
in computer science). These skills are divided into 7 modules, listed below, but this is in no way intended to
be a comprehensive or objective list.

Another key disclaimer: These are my own opinions, based on my own experiences, and I could very well be
wrong! If you think anything I'm saying here is incorrect, unhelpful, or worse, unethical for any reason,
please [contact me](contact) so we can work to correct it. The purpose of this guide is to help new
students---whatever we can do collectively to acheive that, I'm all for.
