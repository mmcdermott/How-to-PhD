# Adapting to the era of Foundation Models (LLMs)
The last two years have witnessed a remarkable transformation in NLP through the advent of large language
models like GPT-4. This change has been driven not by new, open-source academic discoveries, but by corporate
partners leveraging unparalleled engineering, data, and computational scale to produce large language models
with exceptional performance. While these developments open up new practical and technological opportunities
that can benefit us all, they also pose a significant disruption to the academic research landscape in AI/ML
and NLP in particular. This page contains resources (typically in the form of prompts and recipes) for making
these new tools work for you to enhance your research across the research process. If you have other recipes
or systems you'd like to recommend, please don't hesitate to file an issue or sumbit a PR describing your
changes to this repository!
